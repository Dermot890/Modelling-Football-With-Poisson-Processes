# Modelling-Football-With-Poisson-Processes

Many models of football (eg 538, xPts models) assume that goals arrive according to a Poisson process, so I set out to examine this assumption. While the overall distribution of goals follows a Poisson distribution, there are some anomalies in the data that violate the assumptions underlying the process.
